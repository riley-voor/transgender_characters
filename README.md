# Transgender Characters

Adds transgender characters to Crusader Kings III! 

This mod is designed to allow trans people to enjoy the fantasty without any sort of bigotry. I may create a new mod in the future that is similar but includes options to reject a transgender child, force people into the closet, has negative opinion modifiers for certain religions etc. But this one is not that! Just lets the characters be trans sometimes!

# New Trait

"Transgender" - +5 attraction opinion (cuz trans people are all hotter than cis people as any trans person can attest)

# New Childhood Event

"Coming Out" - Your character's child comes out as trans. They gain the "Transgender" trait and change their gender.
